### Hey there, I'm Matheus Souza. 👋

I'm a Senior Infrastructure Analyst with **7+ years of experience**, and I am actively transitioning my career toward **DevOps & SRE**.

I am now focusing my studies and projects on:

* **Containers & Orchestration:** Kubernetes and Docker
* **IaC:** Terraform
* **CI/CD:** Azure DevOps
* **Automation:** Shell Script & Python

What excites me about DevOps is the power of automation and building resilient, cloud-native systems.

During my spare time, I'm usually studying for new certifications or applying those skills to the projects you'll find here. I also enjoy watching soccer (as a Vasco da Gama fan) and occasionally playing video games.

Ah, I am actively improving my English proficiency through weekly private lessons.
